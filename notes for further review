# Further Enhancements (to be implemented):

# 1. Implement basic messaging between modules (e.g., using queues or shared memory).
# 2. Explore different network topologies (e.g., ring, star, fully connected).
# 3. Implement more sophisticated optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing).
# 4. Integrate cellular automata for initial code structure generation.
# 5. Integrate a language model for code generation and user intent understanding.
# 6. Implement a visualization system for the compiler network and optimization process.
# 7. Thoroughly test and evaluate the compiler's performance and code quality.

This revised code provides a more concrete and practical foundation for your project. It includes basic implementations of modules, a simplified optimization example, and a more structured network representation. 

Remember that this is a simplified example, and you'll need to fill in the actual implementation details for parsing, optimization, code generation, and other functionalities based on your specific requirements and research.
