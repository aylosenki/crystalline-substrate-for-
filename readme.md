# Mycelium-Inspired Compiler

This project explores the concept of a compiler inspired by mycelium networks, swarm intelligence, and other bio-inspired concepts.

**Key Features:**

*   Modular design with loosely coupled modules (Parser, Optimizer, Generator)
*   Swarm intelligence algorithms for code optimization
*   [Add more features here as you implement them]

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

**Usage:**

```python
from compiler import CodeCompiler

user_code = "print('Hello, world!')"
target_language = "Python"

compiler = CodeCompiler()
generated_code = compiler.compile(user_code, target_language)

print(generated_code)
